# Backend Development Program - SideHustle Cohort 7

This repository documents my journey through the **SideHustle Cohort 7 Backend Development Program**, a digital skills initiative aimed at equipping participants with essential programming knowledge and practical development skills. While the program initially offered free learning resources, I was only able to progress to the basics of **PHP** before the introduction of a paid tier that ended my participation.

## About the Program

The **SideHustle Backend Development Program** is part of SideHustle's broader mission to empower individuals across Africa with skills for the digital economy.

I joined the program with enthusiasm and was able to cover the **fundamentals of PHP**, including:

- Variables and data types.
- Basic control structures (if-else statements, loops).
- Basic input and output handling.

Unfortunately, further access required payment, which marked the end of my participation.

## Key Learnings

During my time in the program, I refreshed my foundational knowledge in:

**PHP Basics:**

- Declaring and using variables.
- Writing simple conditional statements and loops.

## Challenges Encountered

- **Program Transition to Paid Model:** The program initially advertised itself as free, which made it accessible to many participants. However, the introduction of a paid tier meant I could not continue beyond the introductory lessons.
- **Limited Practice:** Due to the sudden discontinuation of free access, I wasn’t able to implement projects that would have solidified my learning.

## Future Plans

I plan to:

1. Continue self-learning PHP through free online resources, documentation, and tutorials.
2. Build small-scale backend projects to apply what I’ve learned.
3. Explore other backend frameworks and languages, such as **Node.js**, **Python (Django/Flask)**, and **Ruby on Rails**.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to **SideHustle** for creating this learning opportunity. Their mission to equip African youth with employable digital skills is commendable, and I look forward to exploring more learning avenues in the future.
